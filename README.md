# NHL Playoff Predictor (15-112 Term Project)

## Description
My term project is the “NHL Playoff Predictor.” The main feature of the project is to predict the outcome of an NHL playoff bracket given 16 teams selected by the user. The actual prediction model will be constructed behind the scenes in the code using team statistics from [hockey-reference.com](hockey-reference.com) from the 2017-2018 NHL season. The user will also be able to click on a team and the bracket will highlight its path to the trophy and display percentages on how likely the team is to make it past each round. Another feature is the head-to-head page that predicts the outcome of a single matchup between two teams unrelated to the bracket page. This feature will calculate the odds of the matchup using Monte Carlo simulations in two ways: one based on the teams’ win/loss records and the other based on their average goals per game and average goals against stats. A predicted score using the latter method will also be displayed.

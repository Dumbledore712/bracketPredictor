# NHL Playoff Predictor (15-112 Term Project)

## Description
My term project is the “NHL Playoff Predictor.” The main feature of this project is to predict the outcome of an NHL playoff bracket given 16 teams selected by the user. The actual prediction model will be constructed behind the scenes using each team's overall season statistics from [hockey-reference.com](hockey-reference.com) from the 2017-2018 NHL season. The user will also be able to click on a team on the bracket, highlighting its path to the championship while displaying percentages on how likely the team is to make it past each round.

Another feature is the head-to-head page that makes a prediction on the outcome of a single matchup between two teams. This is separate from the bracket page and . This feature will calculate the odds of a given matchup using Monte Carlo simulation in two ways: one based on the two teams’ win/loss records against each other, and the other based on their overall season statistics (goals for, goals against, etc.). A predicted score using the latter method will also be displayed.
